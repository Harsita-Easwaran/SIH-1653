## Problem Title:Flood Prediction and Warning System
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Flooding causes widespread damage to infrastructure and human life. The challenge is to develop an AI-based system that combines satellite data, weather patterns, and IoT sensor inputs to predict floods accurately. The system should provide early warnings through mobile alerts and a color-coded risk system. It should also offer real-time monitoring, evacuation assistance, and data-driven insights for better disaster response.
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1.AI-Based Prediction â€“ Use machine learning to analyze satellite imagery, weather patterns, and river levels to predict floods.
2.Real-Time Monitoring â€“ IoT-based water level sensors and satellite feeds provide continuous updates.
3.Early Warning System â€“ Mobile notifications and SMS alerts with color-coded risk levels.
4.Evacuation Planning â€“ Generate dynamic evacuation routes based on flood severity and affected areas.
5.Data Insights â€“ Provide real-time analytics and post-event reports for future preparedness.
