## Problem Title:Flood Prediction and Warning System
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Flooding causes widespread damage to infrastructure and human life. The challenge is to develop an AI-based system that combines satellite data, weather patterns, and IoT sensor inputs to predict floods accurately. The system should provide early warnings through mobile alerts and a color-coded risk system. It should also offer real-time monitoring, evacuation assistance, and data-driven insights for better disaster response.

Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

## Idea
1.AI-Based Prediction â€“ Use machine learning to analyze satellite imagery, weather patterns, and river levels to predict floods.
2.Real-Time Monitoring â€“ IoT-based water level sensors and satellite feeds provide continuous updates.
3.Early Warning System â€“ Mobile notifications and SMS alerts with color-coded risk levels.
4.Evacuation Planning â€“ Generate dynamic evacuation routes based on flood severity and affected areas.
5.Data Insights â€“ Provide real-time analytics and post-event reports for future preparedness.

## Use Cases
Real-Time Flood Prediction

User receives an early alert based on AI-based analysis of satellite and weather data.
Evacuation Planning

AI suggests optimized evacuation routes based on flood severity and road conditions.
Government and Emergency Services Monitoring

Authorities monitor real-time flood data and coordinate disaster response.
Community Alert System

Residents receive SMS and mobile alerts about flood status and safety instructions.
Post-Flood Analysis

AI generates detailed reports on flood patterns and infrastructure impact.
